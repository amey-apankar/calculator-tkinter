# Tkinter Calculator

A simple calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. This calculator includes all basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and an user interface with a modern look.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Clear and Reset**: Includes a button to clear the input field.
- **Decimal Support**: Handles decimal points for more precise calculations.

## Installation

1. **Install Tkinter (if not already installed)**:

   Tkinter is included with Python by default. If you're using a version of Python without Tkinter, you can install it as follows:

    - For **Windows**, Tkinter is bundled with Python, so no additional installation is required.


   - For **Ubuntu/Debian**:

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the calculator**:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
